Create a list of songs about all places in america

- webscrape from various sources
- query from spotufy api  
- song name; spotify uri

*need to improve quality of queries
    - ~1000/10000 songs weren't able to be queried from spotify
    - try out the fuzzy wuzzy api?

*instead of csv, with 10,000+ songs would a db be better?
